<tip-box type="important"> 

In this week's tutorial we would like to ensure that,
1. **_All_ students are able to create branch-based PRs without accidentally mixing commits** between PRs (a common mistake)
2. **_At least some members_ of the team are able to resolve merge conflicts and merge PRs**

%%Reason: These two skills are going to be essential for you in future weeks because most of your work will require creating PRs.%%

Therefore, we **strongly encourage you to achieve the `Can create PRs on GitHub` before coming to the tutorial**. If not, you'll have to do it during the tutorial and then there will be less time for you to do the other activities we have planned for this tutorial

</tip-box>

**Within your team**

* Discuss the product(s) you surveyed and its shortcomings with reference to your targeted user group %%(if you haven't already done that)%%  
 
**Explain to the other team**

* What is the user profile your team has chosen?

* This week we don't join teams during the initial discussions; work with your own team members and prepare for the upcoming peer review in week 6. %%(Be mindful of the interaction within and outside the team.)%%

As before, discuss evidence of achieving LOs as directed by the tutor.
