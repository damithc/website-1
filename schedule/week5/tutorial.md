**Suggested activity to do in the tutorial**

1. Explain the class diagram of the [[AddressBook-Level2]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level2/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#design)]. 
   You may ignore the `ReadOnlyPerson` interface (we have not covered _interfaces_ yet)

1. Go through the [provided Java coding standard]({{java_coding_standard}}). 
  Identify and fix any violations of _basic_ style rules in local copy of addressbook-level1 code base. 
  Commit after each fix and push to your own fork.
