                overview of the product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product. This is the first time they are seeing the new product you developed but
                they are familiar with the AddressBook-level4 (AB4) product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Scope</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Each person should demo the enhancements they added</strong>. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
                <li>Subjected to the constraint mentioned in the previous point, as far as possible, organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, presented in a logical order. <span class="dimmed"> Remember to explain the target user profile and value proposition early in the demo.</span></li>
                <li>It is recommended you showcase how the feature improves the user’s life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
                <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
                <li>Mention features you inherited from AB4 only if they are needed to explain your new features. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: existing features will not earn you marks, and the audience is already familiar with AB4 features.</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.</li>
                <li>It can be <strong>a <em>sitting down</em> demo</strong>: You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down. But you may stand around the TV if you prefer that way.</li>
                <li>It will be uninterrupted demo: The audience members will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
                <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of
                  <tooltip content="`Mr aaa` is not a realistic person name"><em>realistic</em></tooltip> data at the start. <span class="dimmed"> e.g at least 20 contacts</span>. Trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample data creates a bad impression.</li>
                <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level. However, do avoid running shorts and flip-flops!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales
                  pitch or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this] <code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code>                  [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code> It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different
                  context → Different requirements.</li>
                <li>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. Poor quality demos can affect your grade.</li>
                <li>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</li>
                <li>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself.</li>
                <li>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells
                  and whistles.</li>
                <li>Limit the demo to CLI inputs only. Do not explain GUI inputs because they don't earn marks.</li>

          <p><strong>Bug Review Period</strong>:</p>
          <p>There will be a review period for you to respond to the <a href="https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S1/pe2-results/issues">bug reports</a> you received.</p>
          <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Tuesday midnight</strong>.</p>
          <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>

            <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs
                  is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Do not edit the subject or the description. Do not close bug reports.</strong> Your response (if any) should be added as a comment.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>If the bug is reported multiple times</strong>, mark all copies EXCEPT one as duplicates using the <code>duplicate</code> tag (if the duplicates have different severity levels, you should <mark>keep the one with the highest severity</mark>).
                  In addition, use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests/">this technique</a> to indicate which issue they are duplicates of. Duplicates can be omitted from processing steps given below.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>If a bug seems to be for a different product</strong> (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know (email prof).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Decide if it is a real bug and apply ONLY one of these labels</strong>.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <tip-box>
              <p>Response Labels:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>response.Accepted</code> : You accept it as a bug.</li>
                <li><code>response.Rejected</code> : What tester thought as a bug is in fact expected behavior. ❗️ The penalty for rejecting a bug using an unjustifiable explanation is higher than the penalty if the same bug was accepted. You can also reject
                  bugs that you inherited from AB4.</li>
                <li><code>response.CannotReproduce</code> : You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.</li>
                <li><code>response.IssueUnclear</code> : The issue description is not clear.</li>
              </ul>
            </tip-box>
            <ul>
              <li>If applicable, <strong>decide the type of bug</strong>. Bugs without <code>type-</code> are considered <code>type-FunctionalityBug</code> by default (which are liable to a heavier penalty):</li>
            </ul>
            <tip-box>
              <p>Bug Type Labels:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>type-FunctionalityBug</code> : the bug is a flaw in how the product works.</li>
                <li><code>type-DocumentationBug</code> : the bug is in the documentation.</li>
              </ul>
            </tip-box>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>If you disagree with the original severity assigned to the bug</strong>, you may change it to the correct level, in which case add a comment justifying the change. All such changes will be double-checked by the teaching team and
                unreasonable lowering of severity will be penalized extra.:</li>
            </ul>

                <p>Bug Severity labels:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>severity.Low</code> : A flaw that is unlikely to affect normal operations of the product. Appears only in very rare situations and causes a minor inconvenience only.</li>
                  <li><code>severity.Medium</code> : A flaw that causes occasional inconvenience to some users but they can continue to use the product.</li>
                  <li><code>severity.High</code> : A flaw that affects most users and causes major problems for users. i.e., makes the product almost unusable for most users.</li>
                </ul>
              </tip-box>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Decide who should fix the bug</strong>. Use the <code>Assignees</code> field to assign the issue to that person(s). There is no need to actually fix the bug though. It's simply an indication/acceptance of responsibility. <strong>If there is no assignee, we will distribute the penalty for that bug (if any) among all team members.</strong></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Add an explanatory comment</strong> explaining your choice of labels and assignees.</p>
              </li>
